Title:
Aurora â€¢ AI Chatbot | Interactive Dataset-driven Assistant

Description:
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Aurora, an interactive AI chatbot that delivers real-time conversations!

Aurora uses a Python FastAPI service to process prompts from the frontend and respond based on a CSV dataset of prompts and replies. The Spring Boot backend handles API requests from the chat interface, making communication seamless.

Key Features:

ðŸŒŸ Real-time AI chat using a CSV dataset as the knowledge base.

ðŸŽ¨ Modern, responsive frontend with animations and typing indicators.

ðŸ§  Case-insensitive matching for consistent responses.

âš¡ Easily extendable by updating the CSV file.

âœ… Health check endpoint for API monitoring.

Tech Stack:
Java (Spring Boot) | Python (FastAPI) | HTML/CSS/JS | REST API | Pandas | CSV dataset
